Things left to do for this website:


1. Create an access token to limit user spam and abuse.

2. ~~Host through Heroku and fix any underlying problems related.~~


Additional tasks after website deployment:


1. Delete if country/providence database snapshot is larger than 30

2. Expand map to other parts of the world, Europe and certain Asian countries priority.


Note to self:

Need to delete the .gitignore config.json, so the website can get the api key to the firebase when you are updating heroku
